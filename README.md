# CS571-S23 HW05: Badger Beats

Welcome to Badger Beats -- Madison's largest up-and-coming music store! In this assignment, you will develop a *multi-page* application using [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) where users can favorite their top hits.

There are sections for both implementation *and* design. **Be sure to complete both!**

## Setup

The starter code provided to you was generated using [create-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app). Furthermore, [bootstrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootstrap), [react-bootstrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-bootstrap), and [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) have already been installed. **You should *not* re-run the create-react-app command**. Instead, in this directory, simply run...

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Then, in a browser, open `localhost:3000`. You should *not* open index.html in a browser; React works differently than traditional web programming! When you save your changes, they appear in the browser automatically. I recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to do your development work.

The components you will be working on are located in the `components` folder. There are several components here; these are just *suggestions*! You can create your React application however you would like.

## Tasks

### 1. Fetch and Display Song Data

On the "Songs" page of the website, display all of the songs from `https://cs571.org/s23/hw5/api/songs`. Be sure to display the song's name, author, genre, publishing year, length, and cover image. Also, include an appropriate `alt` tag for the cover image. Be sure to make your webpage responsive: display 1 column of cards on `xs` devices, 2 columns on `sm`, 3 columns on `md`, 4 columns on `lg`, and 6 columns on `xl`.

### 2. Display Summary Data

With this data, display a sentence above these cards stating...

```
We have XX songs in YY genres for a total of ZZ seconds of music!
```

... where `XX`, `YY`, and `ZZ` are calculated values. A genre is considered the same if the strings match exactly, e.g. "Pop" and "Pop" are the same genre, but "Pop" and "pop" are not. Furthermore, you can assume the length of a song will always be a string formatted like "3:21" or "0:59" or "12:35" or "78:22" where the minutes and seconds are split by a colon.

I would *encourage* but not *require* you to use declarative functions (specifically [reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce)) here. You may find [split](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split) and [parseInt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt) to be helpful as well.

### 3. Favoriting Songs

Add a button to each song that will allow the user to "favorite" the song. When a song is favorited, the button should change so that a user can un-favorite that same song. These favorited songs will then appear on the "Favorites" page implemented in Step 4.

### 4. Display Favorites

Display each of the songs that the user favorited on the "Favorites" page. In addition, display...

```
You have favorited XX songs in YY genres for a total of ZZ seconds of music!
```

... using the same logic as in Step 2 with the totals derived from **just** the favorited songs. When a user chooses to remove a favorite, the card should disappear from the favorites page and the total number of favorited songs, genres, and seconds should be updated.

How you choose to implement this sibling-to-sibling component communication is up to you! In the starter code, I have included some suggestion of using context. You may also choose to store data via `cookies`, `sessionStorage`, or `localStorage`, or you may consider using a third-party state management library like [redux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux) or [mobx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mobx). Data only needs to be persisted between page switches -- if the user refreshes, it is okay for their favorites to be cleared.

That is it for Badger Beats! Now, consider and answer these design questions...

### Design Questions

The following questions ask about principles of interaction and visual design as they relate to Badger Beats. Please answer them by *modifying this README*, replacing "INSERT YOUR RESPONSE HERE" with your response. Thoughtful responses of 2-4 sentences grounded in content from the lectures should suffice.

1. Assume that Badger Beats contains thousands of songs. How would you load and display the results in an efficient manner?

I would load the load them and display with groups divided with Genre or released year. Dividing thousands of data with smaller group will be easier to lookup for the user instead of full data being loaded.

2. Assume that Badger Beats contains thousands of songs. How would you help users narrow down their results?

We can narrow down the results with divided groups based on Genre, artists or year. Later when the user adds favorite music, based on the favorite musics genre or artist, we can show the results with same genre or artist at first to recommend other songs that the user might like.

3. What are three aspects of visual design that *you used* in your implementation of Badger Beats?

We had to keep the balance of music cards on our web to make it more stable and clean. The contrast of button color would make it easier for users to recognize if the music is added in favorite or not. Had to find the appropriate size for fonts and set the appropriate scale for cards and other informations showing up to make sure the interface doesn't break up when we change the size of window and the size of font are balanced which will make it easier to catch what it is.

4. What are three aspects of visual design that *could be used* to improve your implementation of Badger Beats?

I could have added some pattern and variety to differentiate the group of music. Maybe I could include some line to seperate section inside the interface which will make it easier to look and find what the user want. Could have added some value to the music card to differentiate favorite musics and others.

### Done! ðŸ¥³

*Be sure to complete the design questions above!*

Congrats! Add, commit, and push your files to GitHub Classroom and paste your commit hash in the Canvas assignment.
